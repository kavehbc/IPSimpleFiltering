Image Processing - Simple Filtering

This is my assignment for the course of Image Processing at the National University of Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) in 2010.
This software runs the following image processing filters:
- Local Averaging
- Median
- Log

In addition, it also draws the histogram of the photo.
