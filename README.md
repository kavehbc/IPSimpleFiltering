Image Processing - Simple Filtering

This is my assignment for the course of Image Processing at the National University of Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia) in 2010.
This software does simple image processing filterings:
- Local Averaging
- Median
- Log

In addition, it also draws the histogram of the photo.
